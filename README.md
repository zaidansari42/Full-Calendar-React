# Full-Calendar-React

This is a simple React application integrating the FullCalendar library to display and manage events in a calendar format.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zaidansari42/Full-Calendar-React.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Full-Calendar-React
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the app in development mode and open it in your default web browser. You can view the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

2. Customize the calendar:

   - Open the `src/App.js` file and modify the calendar component to suit your requirements.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import FullCalendar from '@fullcalendar/react'; // Import the FullCalendar component
   import dayGridPlugin from '@fullcalendar/daygrid'; // Import any additional plugins you need

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <FullCalendar
           plugins={[dayGridPlugin]} // Add necessary plugins
           initialView="dayGridMonth" // Set the initial view
           events={[
             // Add your events here
             { title: 'Event 1', date: '2023-12-01' },
             { title: 'Event 2', date: '2023-12-05' },
             // ...
           ]}
         />
       </div>
     );

   Customize the `events` array with your own event data.
